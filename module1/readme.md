# What we did 
We experienced how to work with WARA ops and with large amounts of data (that is incomplete) and how to leverage pandas :*(


For metrics lab the assignment was somewhat vague hur its was intreating/frustrating to work with data that did not have any ground truth. But by making some assumptions and creating tools to investigate and look at the result. 

However we did not put to much effort to dig deep in the data.
